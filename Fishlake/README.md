# Fishlake
Fishlake mini version 1 is used to collect dynamic and static data. Using the iOS application found here https://testflight.apple.com/join/MpLxyleo the user can start logging data to flash, stream data, save data to iOS device, and end tests. If logging to the Fishlake mini hardware, the FishlakePullandPlot.exe file can be used to pull the data from saved flash memory, and plot adc, imu, mag, and temp data.


XO-Sole User Manual

Introduction
This is a step-by-step guide for XO-NANO’s XO-Sole (Smartfoam enabled 3D force measurement insole). All components of the XO-Sole are built into the insole itself. The components within the insole include:
1.	XO-NANO BLE Microcontroller and battery – charged by plugging in the USB-c port to a power source and turning the XO-Sole switch to “ON”.
2.	Smartfoam impact sensor – one insole sensor that measures the Smartfoam’s voltage response in 6 locations (medial ball, lateral ball, anterior arch, posterior arch, medial heel, and lateral heel).
3.	Insole stiffener – a 3D-printed component that supports the heel and arch while also protecting the microcontroller and battery.
This guide will instruct you on how to prepare and use each XO-Sole.
Set Up and Connect to the XO-Sole
The XO-Soles are sold as a pair with both left and right smart insoles. Each insole has a very light inscription on the bottom of the 3D-printed insole stiffener that shows the limits of what the user can trim the insole to fit their shoes, shown as a half-circle. In the arch of both XO-Soles, there is a USB-C port that connects to the microcontroller and a small switch farther toward the toes. If any of these components appear to be missing or damaged, the insole may not function.
1.	Charging the insoles.
a.	Charge the XO-Sole by plugging in a USB-C cable to the port in the arch and turning the power switch to “ON” (towards the toes). It should take two to three hours of charging from a dead battery to a complete charge. When the insoles are connected to the app and not charging, the app will display the battery percentage for each insole. To stop charging, flip the switch off and unplug each insole.
2.	Cut the insoles to the appropriate size.
a.	Pull out the shoe’s original insole and use it to cut the toe box of the XO-Sole to the same size and shape. Avoid cutting beyond the rounded, inscribed line. Use a smaller-sized XO-Sole if the original insole is much smaller than the selected XO-Sole. Place the cut XO-Sole inside of the shoe and be sure that it fits appropriately. Make any additional cuts as deemed necessary, while avoiding cutting well beyond the rounded inscription. Cutting beyond the inscription may damage the sensitive electronics in the XO-Sole and make the insole unusable.
3.	Open the XO-Sole app on an iPhone or iPad (iOS device).
4.	Turn on both XO-Soles.
a.	Push the switch towards the toe box and the microcontroller will turn on. Turn on the right insole first, and confirm it is connected on the applications home screen.  Once the right insole is connected, turn on the left insole. Check the XO-Sole app to see if both microcontrollers have been connected to the phone. If both are powered and connected correctly, then the app should display a message, “Connected”, in green, above each virtually displayed insole. 
5.	Slip the insoles in the user’s shoes.
a.	The user’s original insoles should be removed from the shoe for a more comfortable fit, though this is not necessary.
6.	Toggle the “Record” button on the XO-Sole app.
7.	Start the test.
a.	The XO-Sole will measure the 3-dimensional forces of dynamic impacts during walking, running, or jumping and the pressure during static compression while standing, squatting, or balancing.
8.	Toggle the “Record” button on the XO-Sole app when the test has been completed.
9.	Pull out the XO-Soles and turn them off to conserve battery power until the next use.
a.	The battery should last for approximately 9 hours   of use after a full charge.
