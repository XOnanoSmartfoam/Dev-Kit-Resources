# XO-NANO Dev-Kit-Resources
This repository contains all of the support resources for the XO-NANO Development Kit. These resources will be updated on a constant basis so please check back if you are having issues and we may have resolved them in current releases.

# XO-NANO Impact
The primary way to measure XO-NANO impact foam is by using the XO-NANO microcontroller sysyem. The current release of this system is XO-NANO Baldy Rev 2. This board has some limitations due to a manufacturing defect which only allows the board to broadcast the measurements and doesn't allow for on board storage. When XO-NANO Baldy Rev 3 is released we will have the onboard flash working.

A user's guide for the XO-NANO microcontroller and its accompanying iOS app can be found in the XO-NANO Smartfoam Development Kit User Guide
